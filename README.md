# FacialTherapyGame

A gamified facial therapy system using computer vision that helps patients with central facial paralysis perform rehabilitation exercises through interactive gaming mechanics. The facial metrics module is a modified version of [Emotrics](https://github.com/dguari1/Emotrics).

## Description

FacialTherapyGame is a thesis project that integrates computer vision and gaming to create an engaging rehabilitation tool for facial therapy. The system:

- Uses real-time facial gesture recognition to detect and classify therapeutic facial movements
- Integrates a modified version of Emotrics for facial symmetry analysis and metric calculation
- Transforms traditional facial exercises into interactive gameplay through a fishing-themed game
- Provides quantitative metrics and feedback based on Emotrics' facial measurement algorithms
- Aims to improve therapy adherence by making exercises more engaging and motivating

## Features

- Real-time facial gesture detection and classification using CNN
- Facial metrics analysis powered by modified Emotrics algorithms:
  - Facial symmetry measurements
  - Range of motion tracking
  - Landmark detection and analysis
- Interactive fishing game controlled by facial movements
- Progress tracking and performance metrics
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Visualization of facial metrics and session data
- Support for three key therapeutic gestures: kiss, smile, and mouth opening
